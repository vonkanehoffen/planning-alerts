# Scraper notes

There's sometimes main county councils like Kent:
https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/services/recycling-waste-and-environment/planning-in-hertfordshire/planning-applications-decisions/planning-applications-decisions.aspx
That have "Minerals, Waste etc" planning then 

borough councils:
https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/about-the-council/how-the-council-works/district-and-borough-councils.aspx
That have residential. Are there overlaps?

So
Leicester COUNTY COUNCIL for instance:
We administer applications which relate to:

Mineral development eg quarrying
Waste developments eg landfill sites
Council's own developments 
We don't deal with applications for:

householder eg extensions
residential eg housing estates
commercial eg offices or shops

(they;re district concerns)
